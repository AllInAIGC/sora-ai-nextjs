            <h3 className='my-2 text-xl font-semibold'>
              Why is Sora AI significant?
            </h3>
            <p className='my-2'>
              It introduces an interesting three-stage approach, setting new
              benchmarks for quality, flexibility, fine-tuning, and efficiency
              with a focus on further eliminating hardware barriers.

            <h2 className='my-2 text-xl font-semibold'>Technical Aspects</h2>
            <h3 className='my-2 text-xl font-semibold'>
              What are the different variants of Sora AI?
            </h3>
            <p className='my-2'>
              There are two variants: SVD and SVD-XT. SVD creates 576Ã—1024
              resolution videos with 14 frames, while SVD-XT extends the frame
              count to 24.

            <h3 className='my-2 text-xl font-semibold'>
              What are the frame rates of Sora AI models?
            </h3>
            <p className='my-2'>
              Both models, SVD and SVD-XT, can generate videos at frame rates
              ranging from 3 to 30 frames per second.
            </p>
            <h3 className='my-2 text-xl font-semibold'>
              What are the limitations of Sora AI?
            </h3>
            <p className='my-2'>
              The model has difficulties generating videos without motion,
              cannot be controlled by text, struggles with rendering text
              legibly, and sometimes inaccurately generates faces and people.
